\section{Introduction}
I am a fourth year PhD student in Economics, and thus learning how to deal with data will help my research a lot. After reading a few pages of the recommended materials, I realized that my coding is just a mess, and definitely needs to be improved. I also encountered many problems the handbook mentioned and frustrated a lot. Now I am working on projects in the US Airline Industry and hope my future, as well as my previous, coding will be improved and save my trouble. I am also interested in big data and machine learning. These methods will help me manage my data better and make my life easier. I would like to find a professor position after graduation.
